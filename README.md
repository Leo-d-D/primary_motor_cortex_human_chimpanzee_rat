# Primary motor cortex of humans, chimpanzees, and rats

This repository contains the code and data used in the manuscript "". The snRNA-seq data of human was obtained from the published work 
[Comparative cellular analysis of motor cortex in human, marmoset and mouse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03465-8), 
and the chimpanzees ((https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-depxfwd) and rats (https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-yio1gaw) data were downloaded from [BICCN](https://www.biccn.org/). 

# Getting started

This package uses python 3.10, you can also run the scripts on google colab. 
Below are the required libraries. 

<br> ***scipy***
<br> ***anndata***
<br> ***pandas***
<br> ***seaborn***
<br> ***scib_metrics***
<br> ***scvi***
<br> ***harmony***
<br> ***torch***
<br> ***scrublet***
<br> ***devCellpy***

For DEG analysis, R package ***limma***, ***edgeR***, ***dplyr***, ***magrittr***, ***reticulate***, and ***scipy.parse*** were used.
For signaling pathway enrichment study, R package ***cellchat*** was used.

For classfication, the XGBoost implementation in ***devCellpy*** was used.
